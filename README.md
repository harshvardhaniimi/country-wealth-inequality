# Wealth data, country level, as scraped from Wikipedia.
Data scraped from Wikipedia about 153 countries' economic wealth and inequality indicators. This is my first ever scraping. It was pretty simple one, once I found an online guide. I used "rvest" package in R to do this.

R codes, website snapshot and resulting CSV files are appended.
